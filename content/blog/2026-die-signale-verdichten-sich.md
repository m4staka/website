Simon Willison in his [LLM Predictions for 2026](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/):

> "I think that there are still people out there who are convinced that LLMs cannot write good code. Those people are in for a very nasty shock in 2026."

The signals are coming from everywhere:

- [antirez](https://antirez.com/news/158) (Redis creator): "Writing code yourself is no longer sensible, if not to have fun."
- [Linus Torvalds](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/11/linus-torvalds/) vibe-coded a Python tool: "I cut out the middle-man — me."
- Simon Willison on the [November 2025 Inflection Point](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/4/inflection/): GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 crossed an invisible threshold.
- [Armin Ronacher](https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/2010643147710148772) (Flask creator): Poll showing a majority of respondents now have most of their code written by AI.
