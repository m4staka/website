Matt Shumers essay ["Something Big Is Happening"](https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening) went viral on X. Its about a supposed avalanche of AI that will hit us like Corona did and will wipe out quite some jobs. You don't need to read that essay. I hate it.

I hate it because of the fear that it spreads. Comparing the upcoming AI to Corona paints quite a specific picture and I think its wrong. Corona turned the world upside down in from one moment to the next and caused quite some harm and fear. AI is going to be a big deal, no doubt, but it will not turn the world upside down like that virus did. Because AI is no virus that spreads uncontrolled rather diffuses slowly into our everyday life.

But everyday people not familiar with AI dont know that and I am afraid that essay stirs shit up for no reason. Only to give Matt Shumers his five minutes of fame.

This post ["Why I’m not worried about AI job loss"](https://davidoks.blog/p/why-im-not-worried-about-ai-job-loss) also critiques Shumers essay and does it in a more articulate way that I can. Please read that instead.

I really would love for everyone to calm down a bit. But I guess we are too far ahead on the hype train already.
