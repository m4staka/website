I loved this episode with Grady Booch on software engineering history and future (AI of course):

{{< youtube McAL6jkRUO4 >}}

He is around for decades and has seen a lot. I found it really interesting that he lived through something similar to whats happening with AI two times already (compilers and higher order languages). Every time software engineers feared about their jobs and every time they have been better of in the end. In his experience AI is another level of abstraction. Nevertheless the same fundamentals will still matter (abstraction, coupling, cohesion, judgement).

I really love his calm take on AI. Its refreshing.

Also he thinks AI is not able to do "abductive reasoning" and that will limit its abilities. I dont know whether thats true but its a novel argument at least.

Grady Booch also appearon on the [pragmatic podcast](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-third-golden-age-of-software). While this is also great and I recommend the episode. I liked his appearence on the Oxide podcast a bit more.
